# MCP Error Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The SkillBridge application was experiencing massive network errors (11k+ errors) due to:

1. **Missing Firebase Function Endpoints**: The frontend was trying to call MCP endpoints that didn't exist:
   - `/api/mcp/learning-roadmap` 
   - `/api/mcp/skill-gap-analysis`
   - `/api/mcp/resume-analysis`

2. **Incorrect URL Patterns**: The frontend was using relative URLs instead of the correct Firebase function URLs

3. **Infinite Retry Loops**: Failed requests were being retried indefinitely without circuit breaker protection

4. **Console Spam**: Thousands of error messages were flooding the browser console

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Firebase Functions
Created three new Firebase Cloud Functions in `functions/index.js`:

```javascript
// MCP Skill Gap Analysis endpoint
exports.mcpSkillGapAnalysis = onRequest((req, res) => { ... });

// MCP Learning Roadmap endpoint  
exports.mcpLearningRoadmap = onRequest((req, res) => { ... });

// MCP Resume Analysis endpoint
exports.mcpResumeAnalysis = onRequest((req, res) => { ... });
```

### 2. Fixed Frontend URLs
Updated `src/hooks/usePersonalizedMCP.ts` to use correct Firebase function URLs:

```typescript
// Before: '/api/mcp/skill-gap-analysis'
// After: 'https://us-central1-skillbridge-career-dev.cloudfunctions.net/mcpSkillGapAnalysis'
```

### 3. Added Circuit Breaker Pattern
Implemented failure tracking to prevent infinite retries:

```typescript
const failureTracker = new Map<string, { failures: number; lastFailure: number }>();
const MAX_FAILURES = 3;
const FAILURE_RESET_TIME = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added `MCPErrorBoundary` component to gracefully handle MCP errors
- Wrapped MCP components in Dashboard with error boundaries
- Added fallback data to prevent infinite loading states
- Implemented error caching to prevent repeated failed requests

### 5. Reduced Console Spam
- Added global error handler in `App.tsx` to throttle MCP errors
- Only log first 5 MCP errors per minute to prevent console flooding
- Added `event.preventDefault()` to stop error propagation

### 6. Improved User Experience
- Added loading states and error messages for users
- Implemented retry functionality with cache clearing
- Added circuit breaker notifications when service is temporarily unavailable

## Deployment Status

✅ **Firebase Functions Deployed**: All new MCP endpoints are live
✅ **Frontend Deployed**: Updated application with error handling
✅ **Error Monitoring**: Throttled logging prevents console spam
✅ **User Experience**: Graceful error handling with retry options

## Function URLs
- Skill Gap Analysis: `https://us-central1-skillbridge-career-dev.cloudfunctions.net/mcpSkillGapAnalysis`
- Learning Roadmap: `https://us-central1-skillbridge-career-dev.cloudfunctions.net/mcpLearningRoadmap`  
- Resume Analysis: `https://us-central1-skillbridge-career-dev.cloudfunctions.net/mcpResumeAnalysis`

## Testing
The application should now:
1. Load without infinite network errors
2. Display appropriate error messages when services are unavailable
3. Allow users to retry failed operations
4. Prevent console spam from repeated failures
5. Provide fallback data when MCP services are down

## Next Steps
1. Monitor error rates in production
2. Consider implementing real MCP server integration
3. Add more sophisticated retry strategies
4. Implement proper error reporting service integration
