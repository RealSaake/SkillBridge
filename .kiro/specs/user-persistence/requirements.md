# User Persistence & State Management Requirements

## Introduction

SkillBridge currently suffers from a critical flaw: it has no memory. The application treats every user as a stranger on every visit, forcing them to repeat onboarding and losing all personalization. This spec addresses the implementation of true user persistence, transforming SkillBridge from a beautiful but stateless shell into a personalized, intelligent platform that remembers and grows with its users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Persistent User Profiles

**User Story:** As a developer using SkillBridge, I want my profile data, preferences, and progress to be saved permanently so that I don't have to re-enter information on every visit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete the onboarding quiz THEN my responses SHALL be permanently stored in the database linked to my user account
2. WHEN I return to the platform after logging out THEN my profile data SHALL be automatically loaded and displayed
3. WHEN I update my career goals or preferences THEN these changes SHALL be persisted immediately
4. WHEN I mark learning milestones as complete THEN this progress SHALL be saved and visible on future visits
5. IF the database is unavailable THEN I SHALL see a clear error message and the system SHALL retry automatically

### Requirement 2: Seamless Authentication Flow

**User Story:** As a user, I want a smooth authentication experience that distinguishes between new and returning users so that I'm taken to the appropriate part of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I authenticate with GitHub for the first time THEN I SHALL be directed to the onboarding quiz
2. WHEN I authenticate as a returning user THEN I SHALL be taken directly to my personalized dashboard
3. WHEN I complete onboarding THEN my profile SHALL be created and I SHALL be redirected to the dashboard
4. WHEN I sign out THEN all my data SHALL be cleared from the browser session
5. WHEN my session expires THEN I SHALL be prompted to re-authenticate without losing my current context

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Dashboard Personalization

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want my dashboard to reflect my personal data, progress, and goals so that the platform feels tailored to my career journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view my dashboard THEN it SHALL display my actual GitHub repositories and activity
2. WHEN I view my learning roadmap THEN it SHALL show my saved progress and next steps
3. WHEN I complete roadmap items THEN my progress SHALL update in real-time and be saved permanently
4. WHEN I view skill gap analysis THEN it SHALL be based on my saved career goals and current skills
5. WHEN I access any feature THEN it SHALL use my persistent profile data for personalization

### Requirement 4: Progress Tracking & Persistence

**User Story:** As a learner, I want my progress through learning roadmaps and skill development to be tracked and saved so that I can see my growth over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I mark a learning milestone as complete THEN it SHALL be saved to my profile immediately
2. WHEN I view my roadmap THEN completed items SHALL remain checked across sessions
3. WHEN I update my skill assessments THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in my skill gap analysis
4. WHEN I achieve learning goals THEN my progress metrics SHALL update and be permanently stored
5. WHEN I export my progress THEN it SHALL include all historical data from my profile

### Requirement 5: Data Integrity & User Isolation

**User Story:** As a user, I want assurance that my personal data is secure, isolated from other users, and accurately maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access my profile THEN I SHALL see only my own data, never another user's information
2. WHEN multiple users are active simultaneously THEN each SHALL have completely isolated data access
3. WHEN I delete my account THEN all my personal data SHALL be permanently removed from the system
4. WHEN data corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL detect it and prevent displaying incorrect information
5. WHEN I update my profile THEN the changes SHALL be validated and saved atomically
