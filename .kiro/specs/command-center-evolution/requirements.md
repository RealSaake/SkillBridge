# Command Center Evolution Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for evolving SkillBridge from its current dashboard layout into a comprehensive Command Center that provides users with a holistic, interactive view of their career development journey. The Command Center will transform the existing 2-column grid layout into a multi-column, widget-based dashboard that offers deeper insights, real-time data visualization, and enhanced user interaction capabilities.

The evolution focuses on three core areas: an enhanced Command Center Dashboard with rich visualizations, an Interactive Resume Reviewer with contextual feedback, and a Job Market Insights Hub with real-time market data.
