# Fix SkillBridge - Production Readiness Requirements

## üö® **PROJECT MISSION**
Transform SkillBridge from a prototype with mock data into a **production-ready, user-tested platform** that delivers real value to developers seeking career advancement.

## üìä **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**

### ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**
1. **Mock Data Contamination**: Users see fake/shared data instead of their own
2. **Poor User Experience**: Confusing flows, unclear value proposition
3. **Broken Authentication**: Users can't distinguish their data from others
4. **Incomplete Features**: Many components show "Coming Soon" instead of working features
5. **No Real GitHub Integration**: Authentication works but data fetching is broken
6. **Unprofessional UI**: Looks like a prototype, not a production app
7. **No User Onboarding**: Users don't understand what they're signing up for
8. **Missing Error Handling**: Poor error states and loading experiences
9. **No Performance Optimization**: Slow loading, no caching, poor UX
10. **Untested User Flows**: No validation of real user journeys
