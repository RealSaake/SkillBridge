## Content Enhancement Rules

### Action Verb Usage
- Start bullets with strong action verbs: "Developed", "Implemented", "Optimized"
- Avoid weak verbs: "Worked on", "Helped with", "Participated in"
- Use past tense for completed projects, present for ongoing

### Quantification Guidelines
- Include GitHub metrics: stars, forks, contributors, commits
- Estimate user impact: "serving X users", "processing Y requests"
- Highlight performance improvements: "reduced load time by X%"
- Show scale: "managing X repositories", "handling Y concurrent users"

### Technical Depth Balance
- **Frontend Role**: Emphasize UI/UX, responsive design, performance
- **Backend Role**: Focus on APIs, databases, scalability, security
- **Full Stack**: Balance both frontend and backend achievements
- **Data Science**: Highlight algorithms, data processing, model performance

## ATS Optimization

### Keyword Integration
- Extract keywords from job descriptions when provided
- Include relevant technical terms naturally in content
- Use standard job titles and technology names
- Avoid graphics, tables, or complex formatting

### Format Requirements
- Use standard section headers (Experience, Education, Skills)
- Maintain consistent date formats (MM/YYYY)
- Use bullet points for easy parsing
- Include contact information in header

### File Format Considerations
