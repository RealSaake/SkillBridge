# Railway Deployment Status

## Current Issue
Railway deployment is failing during the build phase. The nixpacks configuration is working, but the build process is not completing successfully.

## What We've Tried
1. ✅ Fixed nixpacks.toml configuration
2. ✅ Added environment variables to Railway
3. ✅ Simplified server code to minimal GitHub OAuth functionality
4. ✅ Fixed TypeScript compilation issues
5. ❌ Railway deployment still failing

## Current Configuration

### Environment Variables (Set in Railway)
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Ov23liDhBul8KpUPT8w3`
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=7f27775abdba96fce4d82411dab99d9141fb6987`
- `FRONTEND_URL=https://skillbridgev1.vercel.app`
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=skillbridge-production-ea3f.up.railway.app`

### Server Code
- Simplified to just GitHub OAuth endpoints
- Builds successfully locally
- Uses minimal dependencies (express, cors, dotenv)

## Next Steps
1. **Check Railway Dashboard**: Go to Railway web interface to see detailed build logs
2. **Manual Redeploy**: Try triggering a redeploy from Railway dashboard
3. **Alternative**: Consider using Railway's GitHub integration instead of CLI

## Test URLs (Once Working)
- Health Check: https://skillbridge-production-ea3f.up.railway.app/health
- GitHub OAuth: https://skillbridge-production-ea3f.up.railway.app/api/auth/github
- Frontend: https://skillbridgev1.vercel.app

## Expected Flow
1. User visits https://skillbridgev1.vercel.app
2. Clicks "Connect to GitHub"
3. Redirects to Railway backend OAuth endpoint
4. Completes GitHub OAuth flow
5. Returns to frontend with authentication tokens
