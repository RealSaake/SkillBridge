## SOUL ANALYSIS

### Core Purpose
SkillBridge exists to be the **autonomous AI-driven career architect** that transforms developers' GitHub activity, skills, and aspirations into actionable career advancement. It bridges the gap between where developers are and where they want to be through intelligent analysis, personalized roadmaps, and continuous guidance.

### The Five Critical Missing Features

1. **Interactive Resume Reviewer with Visual Overlay**
   - STATUS: üö´ NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - DESCRIPTION: Upload PDF resume, receive AI analysis with visual annotations directly overlaid on the document
   - IMPACT: This is the killer feature that differentiates us from generic career advice

2. **Real-time Skill Radar with Live GitHub Sync**
   - STATUS: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
   - DESCRIPTION: Dynamic skill visualization that updates as users push code, with trend analysis
   - IMPACT: Users need to see their skills evolving in real-time

3. **Fully Interactive Roadmap Kanban Board**
   - STATUS: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED  
   - DESCRIPTION: Drag-and-drop milestone management with persistent state and progress tracking
   - IMPACT: Learning paths must be interactive, not just informational

4. **Command Center Dashboard with Multi-Column Grid**
   - STATUS: ‚ö†Ô∏è BASIC IMPLEMENTATION
   - DESCRIPTION: Pixel-perfect responsive grid matching Figma designs with all widgets operational
   - IMPACT: The dashboard is the user's mission control - it must be flawless

5. **Autonomous Career Insights Engine**
   - STATUS: üö´ NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - DESCRIPTION: AI that proactively suggests career moves based on market trends and user activity
   - IMPACT: True AI-driven guidance, not reactive analysis

```
src/hooks/useCareerInsights.ts:147 - TODO: Integrate with MCP portfolio-analyzer server
mcp-servers/portfolioAnalyzer.ts:109 - TODO: Implement Redis-based rate limiting
```

### Console.log Statements (Development Artifacts)
```
src/runPreflightChecks.ts:12,15,16,17 - Console logging in production code

```
src/services/__mocks__/GitHubService.ts - Mock data structures (acceptable for testing)
src/lib/mcpFunctions.ts - Fallback data for MCP functions (VIOLATION - should be removed)
src/hooks/useCareerInsights.ts - Hardcoded skill gap analysis fallbacks (VIOLATION)
```

### Mock Data Usage (CRITICAL VIOLATIONS)
```
src/services/__mocks__/GitHubService.ts - Mock GitHub service for testing (acceptable)
src/lib/mcpFunctions.ts - Contains fallback mock data in production code (CRITICAL VIOLATION)
Multiple test files using mock implementations (acceptable for testing)
```
